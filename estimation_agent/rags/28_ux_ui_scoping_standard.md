# UX/UI Scoping and Estimation Standards (4-Phase Model)

This document defines the standard effort units and scoping logic for UX/UI design phases. Use this to determine costs when users specify their "Design Readiness".

## 1. Design Readiness (Triage) Categories

| Category | Typical Scope | Action for AI Consultant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Ideas Only (Zero Start)** | Phases 1, 2, 3 | Discuss if research (Phase 1) is needed. Otherwise, focus on Phase 2 (IA/Wireframes). |
| **B. Specs Only (Needs Design)** | Phases 2, 3 | **Standard case.** Focus on screen count for IA and UI design. |
| **C. Layout Only (Needs UI)** | Phase 3 | Skip IA/Wireframes. Focus on Visual Design (Phase 3). |
| **D. Design Complete (Ready)** | N/A | Skip all UX/UI costs unless "Design Review" or "Implementation Handoff" is asked. |

## 2. Sub-step Filtering (Selection Logic)

AI consultants should verify exactly which deliverables are required to refine the estimate.

### Phase 2 (Design/Figma Bridge) Filter
- **Nature**: SIer Internal task (Young staff). **NOT outsourced.**
- **Excluded**: Only if the client provides professional-grade Figma wireframes. Rough Excel/Hand-drawn plans from the client still require this phase (SIer handles the conversion).
- **Mandatory**: Prerequisite for professional UI design (Phase 3).

### Phase 3 (Visual/Professional UI) Filter
- **Nature**: External task. **ALWAYS outsourced** to design companies.
- **Mandatory**: Professional design work based on Phase 2 outputs.

## 3. Phase-specific Effort Units

### Phase 2: 設計フェーズ (Internal/Dev Focus)
- **IA / Sitemap**: 2.0h per screen (includes hierarchy and logic)
- **Wireframes (Standard)**: 4.0h per screen
- **Wireframes (Detailed/Complex)**: 6.0h per screen

### Phase 3: ビジュアルフェーズ (Visual / UI)
- **Design System Asset**: 40h (Small), 80h (Medium), 160h (Large/Standard)
- **UI Design (Core/Key screens)**: 8.0h - 16.0h per screen
- **UI Design (Sub/Expansion screens)**: 4.0h - 8.0h per screen
- **Prototyping**: 2.0h (Clickable) to 4.0h (Interactive logic) per screen

### Phase 1 & 4: Special Request Items
*These are only included if explicitly requested or for high-budget "Idea Stage" projects.*
- **User Interviews**: 5.0h / person
- **Usability Testing**: 8.0h / person
- **A/B Testing**: 8.0h / variant

## 3. Adjustment Logic & Buffers
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: 0.8 to 1.5 depending on requirement complexity.
- **Risk Multiplier**: 1.0 to 1.3 based on stakeholder count and ambiguity.
- **Standard Buffer**: Add 15% to 30% to the total hours for unexpected design cycles.
